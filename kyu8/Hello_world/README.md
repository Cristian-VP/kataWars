# 8-kyu - Hello 1 & Hello2

## Hello1

-Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".
 -Style Points:
    -Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative "hello world" you can think of?
    What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

## Hello2 
You are given a method called main, make it print the line Hello World!, (yes, that includes a new line character at the end) and don't return anything

Note that for some languages, the function main is the entry point of the program.

Here's how it will be tested:

    java Solution.class parameter1 parameter2

Hints:

Check your references
Think about the scope of your method
If you still don't get it probably you can define main as an attribute of the Solution class that accepts a single argument, and that only prints "Hello World!" without any return.
